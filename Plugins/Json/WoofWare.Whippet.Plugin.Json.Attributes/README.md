# WoofWare.Whippet.Plugin.Json.Attributes

This is a very slim runtime dependency which consumers of WoofWare.Whippet.Plugin.Json may optionally take.
This dependency contains attributes which control that source generator,
although you may instead omit this dependency and control the generator entirely through configuration in consumer's `.fsproj`.
Please see WoofWare.Whippet.Plugin.Json's README for further information.
