# WoofWare.Whippet.Fantomas

Helper methods to access [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas) from within a [Whippet](https://github.com/Smaug123/WoofWare.Whippet) plugin (or elsewhere).

This is *not* intended to be the long-term future of Whippet plugins.
I have created it for compatibility with my existing [Myriad](https://github.com/MoiraeSoftware/myriad) plugins ([WoofWare.Myriad](https://github.com/Smaug123/WoofWare.Myriad/)), to help the transition to Whippet.

As such, the version of Fantomas and the F# compiler is currently pinned to a rather old version.
Once I have migrated WoofWare.Myriad to Whippet, I will upgrade Fantomas here, and there will be breaking changes to the API.
